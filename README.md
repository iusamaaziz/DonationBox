## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- SQL Server (LocalDB for development)
- Redis (optional, for caching)
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

### Running the Services

The system now consists of two microservices that work together. The DonationService depends on the AuthService for authentication.

#### Running AuthService (Required First)

1. **Navigate to the AuthService directory**:
   ```bash
   cd src/Services/AuthService
   ```

2. **Restore dependencies**:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Run the service**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Access Swagger UI**:
   - Navigate to `https://localhost:7002` or `http://localhost:5002`

#### Running DonationService

1. **Navigate to the DonationService directory** (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd src/Services/DonationService
   ```

2. **Restore dependencies**:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Run the service**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Access Swagger UI**:
   - Navigate to `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`

#### Testing the Integration

1. **Register or login via AuthService**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://localhost:7002/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "john.doe@example.com", "password": "Password123!"}'
   ```

2. **Use the returned access token in DonationService**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://localhost:5001/api/campaigns \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "New Campaign", "description": "Test campaign", "goalAmount": 10000}'
   ```

### Configuration

The service uses environment-specific configuration files:

- `appsettings.json`: Base configuration
- `appsettings.Development.json`: Development settings (Redis enabled)
- `appsettings.Production.json`: Production settings template

Key configuration options:
- `UseRedis`: Enable/disable Redis caching
- `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection`: SQL Server connection
- `ConnectionStrings:Redis`: Redis connection string

## Database

The DonationService automatically creates and seeds the database on first run with sample campaigns and donations.

### Sample Data Includes:
- Community Center campaign (Active, $15k raised of $50k goal)
- Emergency Relief Fund (Active, $8.5k raised of $25k goal)
- School Technology Upgrade (Completed, $75k goal reached)

## Development Workflow

This project follows a microservices-first approach where each service is built independently:

1. âœ… **AuthService** - User authentication with JWT and Google OAuth
2. âœ… **DonationService** - Campaign and donation management with authentication integration
3. ðŸš§ **PaymentService** - Payment processing integration (Future)
4. ðŸš§ **NotificationService** - Email and SMS notifications (Future)
5. ðŸš§ **YARP API Gateway** - Centralized API gateway (Future)

## Next Steps

The DonationService is complete and ready for use. Future development will include:

1. **UserService**: Authentication, authorization, and user management
2. **PaymentService**: Integration with payment processors (Stripe, PayPal)
3. **NotificationService**: Email and SMS notifications for donors and campaign creators
4. **API Gateway**: YARP-based gateway for routing and cross-cutting concerns
5. **Frontend Application**: React or Blazor frontend application
6. **Deployment**: Docker containers and Azure deployment scripts

## Contributing

Each service is self-contained and can be developed independently. Follow the established patterns in DonationService for consistency across the system.
